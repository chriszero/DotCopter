To get the examples in this chapter running on real hardware, you need to change the pin numbers
in the code according to the device`s pin set. You can find the pin numbers in the documentation of your development board.
Most hardware sample code in this chapter is written particularly for the emulators of chapter 13.
To run the samples without real hardware, you need to built the emulator projects located in the directory for chapter 13 first.
